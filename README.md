# GRIP (Graduate Rotational Internship Program)
The tasks are given to the interns batch august 2021 in Data Science and Business Analytics domain at SPARKS Foundation.
 
#### Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.\
● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.\
● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? \
● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.

#### Task 2 - Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.\
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.

#### Task 3 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.\
● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.\
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.
